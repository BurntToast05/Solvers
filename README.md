How does it work?
The solver will pull from available words from a 12,000 word bank. Common words take precedence over lesser known words, and the suggestions will create the smallest possible set of resulting words.

What limitations does it have?
Since it is meant to be a 'Hard mode' solver, it only gives suggestions that are valid based on the hints you received. This makes it different than other solvers, who solely guess words that decrease the solution set the most.

Speed Issues?
I have it limited to give the best solution with less than 250 possible words. If the available words is over 250, it will return a valid solution with every letter being unique.
